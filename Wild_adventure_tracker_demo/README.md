This is a demo for WIO GPS Board, named Wild Adventure Tracker.

There are 3 functions in this demo:

1. When you press the Grove Button, the board will send a message to the phone number you set(in the code), which contains your coordinates.

2. When the Wild Adventure Tracker falls from height(more than 2 meters), it will send a message with coordinates to the phone number you set.

3. When anyone send a message "where" to your Wild Adventure Tracker, it will send back its coordinates.
